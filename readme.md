Move the ball with the directional buttons and collect all bubbles.
The ball will continue moving into the same direction until it hits
a wall or the blocker.

The blocker can be moved in same way as the ball except it also stops
when at hits the ball or a bubble.

Press the B-button to switch control between the ball and the blocker.
A joystick will wiggle its way from the ball to the blocker or vice
versa when changing control.

Each time you move the ball or blocker will count as a move. You have 
1024 moves to complete all 25 levels.

As an aid you get 5 special balls. A special ball can be used to either
retry or skip a level. Skipping a level takes a 100 move penalty.
